# codex-index
Indexes of Codices of the Hebrew Bible

Currently it contains indexes for the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex.

(The index for Aleppo is in a different form than the index for Leningrad.)

The files in the folder called "leningrad"
are a subset of
the files in the private repo called "UXLC-utils".

The files in the folder called "leningrad"
are copied here by running main_uxlc_codex_index_copy_files.py
in UXLC-utils/py.
